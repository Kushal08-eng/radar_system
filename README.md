# radar_system
A RADAR system built using an ESP microcontroller to detect and track objects within a defined range. The system uses an ultrasonic sensor mounted on a servo motor to scan surroundings, measure distances in real time, and output object position data. This project demonstrates sensor interfacing, real-time processing, and embedded system design.
